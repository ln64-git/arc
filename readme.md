## What is Arc?

Arc is a decentralized, versioned, cryptographically-verifiable Archive protocol —  
designed to preserve human knowledge, memory, and identity across collapse.

It’s **local-first**, **peer-to-peer**, **source-agnostic**, and **modular**.  
It lets individuals, families, communities, and institutions build living Archives — portable across devices, networks, generations.

Arc is:

- **Git** — but for memory, not just code.  
- **Internet Archive** — but living on your machines, not a single server.  
- **BitTorrent** — but purpose-built for trust, history, and truth.

Arc is a foundation.  
A new standard for sovereign digital preservation.  
The infrastructure for human memory in a post-trust, post-AI world.

## Why Arc?

Because the old internet is dying:

- AI is poisoning public knowledge.  
- Centralized clouds are collapsing or censoring.  
- Institutions are losing legitimacy.  
- Digital identities are being rented, not owned.  
- Public memory is rotting, overwritten silently by systems no one controls.

You cannot save knowledge by yelling at broken systems.  
You have to **build new ones.**

Arc is that new system — rooted, resilient, real.

## What Arc Solves

| Problem | Arc’s Answer |
|:---|:---|
| **Loss of Data Sovereignty** | Local-first Archives you own fully. |
| **Collapse of Institutional Trust** | Verifiable memory without middlemen or authorities. |
| **AI-Driven Data Poisoning** | Signed, versioned truth immune to hallucination. |
| **Centralized Cloud Fragility** | Portable, peer-distributed Archives. |
| **Network Fragility** | Source-agnostic transmission over Wi-Fi, LAN, mesh, drives, radios, or satellites. |
| **Loss of Personal Identity** | Your cryptographic identity signs your memory — not corporations. |

## Big Vision — Grounded Execution

Arc is built to operate at every scale:

| Scale | Example |
|:---|:---|
| **Personal** | A private family Archive with generations of history, photos, and videos. |
| **Community** | A city-wide Archive preserving local music, art, and public records across a mesh network. |
| **Institutional** | A decentralized university Archive for reseArch papers and cultural heritage. |
| **Post-collapse** | Survivor groups syncing Archives over local Wi-Fi and hard drives when the internet fails. |
| **Global** | Interconnected trusted Archives preserving truth across continents without reliance on any single nation, ISP, or corporation. |

Arc is small enough for one person to run.  
Strong enough for a civilization to rebuild on.

## How Arc Works

```plaintext
Arc init    # Create a sovereign Archive
Arc add     # Add files (documents, videos, knowledge, anything)
Arc commit  # Save and sign a cryptographic version
Arc sync    # Push to trusted peers (any medium)
Arc pull    # Fetch and verify updates
Arc verify  # Audit and protect Archive integrity
```

## Source-Agnostic Resilience

Arc moves across:

- Wi-Fi LANs  
- City-wide Mesh Networks  
- ISP internet connections  
- Sneakernet (flash drives, hard drives)  
- Radio relays  
- Satellite links  
- Future networks not yet imagined

If data can move, Arc survives.

## Future-Proof Humanity

Arc isn’t just about backup.  
It’s about **memory ecosystems** for a world where trust has collapsed.

Arc lays the groundwork for:

- **Private AI models** trained on your own verified Archives — not poisoned cloud junk, powered by your own sovereign data, safely and cleanly.  
- **Community resilience** — decentralized libraries, public records, cultural Archives.  
- **Post-state knowledge networks** — cities, families, and movements carrying their truth, independently.

In the world that’s coming, Arc isn’t just an improvement.  
It’s **the only sane option left.**

## Built With

- **Rust** — because Arc has to be fast, secure, and ready for the long collapse.
