## What is Arc?

**Arc** is a decentralized, versioned, cryptographically-verifiable **archive system** —
designed to help people, communities, and institutions **preserve knowledge securely**, **across time and devices**.

Arc offers:

* **Local-first design** — your data lives with you, not the cloud
* **Source-agnostic transport** — share over LAN, mesh, USB, internet, or any medium
* **Peer-to-peer sync** — no servers, no platforms, no lock-in
* **End-to-end encryption** — your data stays private, protected at every step

Think:

* **Git** — for personal and shared memory
* **Internet Archive** — running on your own hardware
* **BitTorrent** — optimized for integrity and version history

Arc aims to provide a practical foundation for secure digital preservation and knowledge sharing.

## Why Arc?

Because today's digital infrastructure is built on borrowed trust:

* Cloud platforms censor, vanish, or lock users out
* Identity is fragmented across platforms
* Knowledge is siloed, unverifiable, or easily overwritten
* AI and automation are eroding provenance and authorship
* Most systems depend on continuous internet and fragile APIs

Arc answers with **sovereignty, transparency, and resilience** —
letting individuals and institutions build secure, auditable, portable archives.

## What Arc Solves

| Challenge                       | Arc’s Solution                                              |
| :------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Sovereignty**            | Local-first Archives you fully control                      |
| **Loss of Institutional Trust** | Verifiable memory with no centralized authorities           |
| **AI-Era Data Drift**           | Signed, versioned snapshots resistant to hallucination      |
| **Cloud Dependency**            | Portable Archives, shareable peer-to-peer over any medium   |
| **Network Fragility**           | Sync over LAN, USB, satellite, mesh — not dependent on ISPs |
| **Identity Ownership**          | Cryptographic signing rooted in your own keys               |

## Arc Phases — From Personal to Global

| Phase               | What It Enables                                            |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 1: Local**  | Private, offline Archives with versioning and audit trails |
| **Phase 2: P2P**    | Sync and share with trusted peers — no servers needed      |
| **Phase 3: Arcnet** | Distributed, federated networks of shared knowledge        |

Each stage builds toward open, decentralized knowledge infrastructure.

## Built for Every Scale

| Use Case          | Example                                                                |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Personal**      | Family archive with photos, journals, and documents                    |
| **Community**     | Mesh-synced cultural records for local events and history              |
| **Institutional** | University archives preserving research with cryptographic trust       |
| **Portable**      | USB or offline-first knowledge kits for education, research, field ops |
| **Global**        | Interoperable truth-sharing across borders, without gatekeepers        |

## How Arc Works

```bash
arc init       # Start a new Archive
arc add        # Add files (any type: text, media, records)
arc commit     # Save and cryptographically sign a version
arc pull       # Sync from a peer, drive, or source path
arc lock       # Encrypt and hide files from view
arc unlock     # Restore content securely from Archive
arc verify     # Audit Archive integrity and authenticity
```

Arc stores everything using content-addressed chunks, encrypted on disk, tracked via signed manifests.

## Source-Agnostic Sync

Arc transmits over:

* Local Wi-Fi and LAN
* USB and external drives
* Internet or VPN tunnels
* Satellite and radio systems
* Future mediums not yet invented

If data can move, Arc can sync it.

---

## Designed for the Long Run

Arc is a tool for:

* **Secure private data management** — your archive, your key
* **Community knowledge sharing** — sync and verify locally
* **Long-term digital preservation** — no dependency on platform uptime
* **Interoperable memory** — with open formats, portable history
* **Trustworthy AI** — training on self-signed, auditable datasets

Arc is more than a backup.
It’s a long-term layer for **trust, memory, and resilience**.
